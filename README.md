Customer Churn Prediction - README
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company using supervised machine learning classification. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions, allowing the business to take proactive retention measures.

🎯 Business Value

Reduce customer churn by identifying at-risk customers early.
Improve customer retention strategies with data-driven insights.
Increase revenue by retaining high-value customers.
Optimize marketing spend by targeting customers with the highest churn risk.

🛠️ Models Implemented

We trained and evaluated six classification models:

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	ROC-AUC
Random Forest (Tuned) 🏆	80.12%	72.35%	79.21%	75.62%	85.04%
Gradient Boosting	79.35%	71.82%	78.45%	74.98%	84.12%
Random Forest (Default)	78.94%	71.25%	77.89%	74.42%	83.76%
Logistic Regression	77.42%	69.87%	75.32%	72.48%	81.95%
Decision Tree	74.82%	67.45%	72.18%	69.71%	78.23%
KNN	74.41%	66.92%	71.54%	69.12%	77.65%
SVM	73.68%	66.34%	70.89%	68.52%	76.87%
🔍 Best Model: Tuned Random Forest

Highest Accuracy (80.12%)
Best ROC-AUC (85.04%)
Balanced Precision & Recall
Why?

Handles imbalanced data well.
Provides feature importance for explainability.
Robust against overfitting.
📊 Key Insights

Top Factors Influencing Churn

Contract Type (Month-to-month customers churn more)
Internet Service (Fiber optic users churn more than DSL)
Tenure (Newer customers are more likely to churn)
Monthly Charges (Higher charges correlate with churn)
Lack of Tech Support / Online Security
Business Recommendations

✅ Target month-to-month customers with loyalty offers.
✅ Improve service quality for fiber optic users.
✅ Bundle tech support & security with internet plans.
✅ Encourage long-term contracts with discounts.
✅ Monitor high-spending customers for dissatisfaction.

🚀 How to Run the Code

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Required libraries:
bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
Steps

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project folder as WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
bash
python churn_prediction.py
(or open in Jupyter Lab/Notebook)
📈 Next Steps

Deploy the model via a Flask/Dash web app for real-time predictions.
A/B test retention strategies based on model insights.
Collect more data (customer feedback, service logs) to improve accuracy.
Implement automated retraining to keep the model updated.
